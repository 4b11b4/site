# Engineer, Not Developer, but Designer

The work of designing the travel destinations of your thumb\
but also other fingers is not to be discarded as _trivial_.

[Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/) once wrote (_I couldn't find the original_):\
"There are only two kinds of coders: those that make "apps" and those solve NPâ€“hard problems."\

I reject this proposition. Designing an interface is an NP-hard problem.

The difficulty of a problem cannot be defined solely by the complexity of it's composition.\
Rightly, some difficult problems are boiled down to a simple composition.

An interface is considered simple in composition or structure\
as it must display information and accepts requests from it's user.

Many algorithms are more complex than the a user interface.

The routing algorithm, if it operates sufficiently, works silently & out of sight.\
The interface is close to the hand, eye and mind of the user.

While these two things may not be equivalent in difficulty,\
their perception of importance should not be equated to difficulty\
and thus "app devs" be designated as lesser.

The interface is a problem of uncomparable magnitude.\
This is no laughing matter. I would never joke.\
I take my new role at Bold Reuse as Jotform Airtable Engineer very seriously.

Below is a collection of the revelations during my time in this role, please, enjoy.
