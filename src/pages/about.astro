		I have a collection of journal prompts for which I recursively
		free-write. One prompt is simply: "Who am I?". Sometimes, it's obvious
		and factual (the next paragraph). Others are abstract or about a memory
		that frames my perspective today.
	</p>

	<p>
		My name is Anton Sebastian Bilbaeno. I was born in San Jose, California
		at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Santa Clara County on January 30th,
		1990 at 6:48 PM to a Rebecca Lynne Payne and Emilio Vincent Carmen
		Bilbaeno.

	<p>
		I am named after the Russian author <a href="/books">Anton Chekhov</a>,
		known for short stories which bring the reader to
		<a href="/spoken">discover meaning in seemingly meaningless</a>
		events of everyday life .
	</p>

	<p>
		My life is the integral over time of my immediate environment. Within
		that environment, experiences that I engage in take me in new
		directions... to new environments with new experiences to choose from.
	</p>

	<p>
		To where I will be taken next --- I do not know. All I can and all I
		must do is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_Eternal"
			>reflect eternally</a
		> and choose my experiences more wisely over time --- while, of course, leaving
		plenty of room for <u><b><i>new</i></b></u> mistakes.
	</p>

	<p>
		To define myself would be an exercise in futility. Everyone is a work in
		progress. Even someone who you've known your whole life -- it would be
		foolish to say "that's just how they are". Even if it's true most of the
		time... this is a limiting perspective. You'll always learn more when
		assume that you don't know.
	</p>
	<p>
		I <i>strive</i> to be a generalist anyway... a polymath. It should be difficult
		to define me. You shouldn't know where to start.
	</p>
	<p>
		When people ask: "So, what do you do?" I usually laugh, followed by an
		"Uhh......"
	</p>
	<p>
		I find that life is most exciting when you can contribute in multiple
		dimensions. The intersections are where the most interesting work is to
		be done.
